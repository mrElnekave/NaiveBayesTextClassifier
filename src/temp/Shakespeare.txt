Many small donations@@($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt@@status with the IRS.@@@@The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating@@charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United@@States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a@@considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up@@with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations@@where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND@@DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular@@state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate@@@@While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we@@have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition@@against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who@@approach us with offers to donate.@@@@International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make@@any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from@@outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.@@@@Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation@@methods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.@@@@Professor Michael S.

Thus, we do not@@necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper@@edition.@@@@Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search@@facility: www.gutenberg.org@@@@This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,@@including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary@@Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to@@subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.@@
